New users are guided through a multi-step onboarding flow that configures their account, business plan, goals, and AI agents. The onboarding state is tracked in the `UserOnboarding` entity and gates access to features until completion.

## Onboarding Flow

The main onboarding wizard (`OnboardingFlow` component) walks users through these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Welcome & Profile">
    Collect basic user information including name, contact details, and profile photo. This establishes the user's identity across the platform.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Business Information">
    Configure your real estate business details:
    - Brokerage name and role
    - Years of experience
    - Specializations (residential, commercial, luxury, etc.)
    - Team size and structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market Territory">
    Define your primary market area:
    - City, state, and zip codes
    - Market type and price ranges
    - Competitive landscape notes

    This data feeds into the MORO (Market Opportunity) intelligence score and is used by AI agents for context-aware responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Income Goals & Production Plan">
    Set your annual financial targets. The Production Planner reverse-engineers your goals:
    - **Target income** (GCI) for the year
    - **Average commission rate** and deal size
    - Calculated number of required deals (buyers + listings)
    - Monthly and weekly activity breakdowns
    - Required appointments, contacts, and lead sources
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preferences & Schedule">
    Configure your working preferences:
    - Daily working hours and available days
    - Communication preferences (email, phone, text)
    - Content tone and style preferences
    - Notification settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Agent Setup">
    Review and configure your AI agents. This triggers the Agent Onboarding flow which introduces each agent (NOVA, SIRIUS, VEGA) and their capabilities.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agent Onboarding

After completing the main onboarding, users go through a separate **Agent Onboarding** (`AgentOnboardingFlow`) when first accessing the AI Agents page. This flow:

- Introduces each available agent and their specialization
- Collects agent-specific preferences (communication style, formality level)
- Sets up initial guidelines for AI responses
- Marks `agentOnboardingCompleted` in the onboarding record

## Call Center Onboarding (PHOENIX)

Subscriber Plus users who access the PHOENIX (Leads Agent) tab undergo a **Call Center Onboarding** (`CallCenterOnboardingFlow`) that:

- Configures phone number and caller ID settings
- Sets up call scripts and greeting templates
- Defines lead qualification criteria
- Marks `callCenterOnboardingCompleted` in the onboarding record

## Onboarding State

The onboarding record (`UserOnboarding` entity) tracks:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `onboardingCompleted` | Main onboarding wizard finished |
| `agentOnboardingCompleted` | AI agent setup finished |
| `callCenterOnboardingCompleted` | PHOENIX call center setup finished |
| `goalsSetupCompleted` | Production planner configured |
| `completedSteps` | Array of completed step identifiers |

<Warning>
Users who have not completed the main onboarding are redirected to `/onboarding` on every page load. Non-admin users cannot bypass this gate.
</Warning>
