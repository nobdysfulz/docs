RolePlay is your personal sales training tool. Practice real estate conversations with an AI opponent through actual phone calls, then get detailed feedback on your performance. It's like having a coach available 24/7.

## Getting There

Click **RolePlay** (or **Training**) in the left sidebar. You'll see three tabs: **Search**, **Results**, and **Scripts**.

## Search Tab — Find a Scenario

Browse available practice scenarios to find the right one for you.

### Featured Scenarios

Popular scenarios are highlighted at the top, each showing:
- The scenario name and description
- A **difficulty badge** (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced)
- The category (buyer, seller, negotiation, objection handling, etc.)
- A **Start** button to begin practicing

### Browsing All Scenarios

Scroll down to browse the full library of scenarios. You can:
- **Filter by category** — Focus on buyer conversations, seller conversations, objections, negotiations, etc.
- **Filter by difficulty** — Start with beginner scenarios and work your way up
- **Search by name** — Looking for something specific? Type it in the search bar

### Custom Scenarios

On the **Subscriber Plus** plan, you can create your own scenarios:
- Define the situation and context
- Describe the person you'll be talking to
- Set specific objections or challenges you want to practice

## How a RolePlay Session Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick a Scenario">
    Choose a scenario from the Search tab and click **Start**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive the Call">
    PULSEIntel Pro calls your phone number (the one in your profile). Answer the call to begin.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Practice the Conversation">
    The AI plays the role of a client — maybe a skeptical buyer, a price-sensitive seller, or someone with a specific objection. Have a natural conversation and practice your techniques.
  </Step>
  <Step title="End the Session">
    When you're done, hang up or click **End Session**. The call is automatically recorded and transcribed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Your Feedback">
    AI analyzes your performance and gives you detailed scores and suggestions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Make sure your phone number is correct in your [Profile](/account/profile) before starting a session. That's the number PULSEIntel Pro will call.
</Note>

## Results Tab — Review Your Performance

After each session, you can review how you did.

### Session History

A table showing all your past sessions with:
- Date and time
- Which scenario you practiced
- How long the session lasted
- Your overall score

Click any session to see the full analysis.

### Performance Analysis

When you click a session, you'll see scores for:
- **Active Listening** — How well you listened to the AI client
- **Validating Feelings** — How effectively you showed empathy and acknowledged concerns
- **Voice Sentiment** — Analysis of your tone and energy during the conversation
- **Objection Handling** — How well you addressed the client's pushback

### Listen Back and Read the Transcript

- **Play the recording** — Listen to the full conversation to hear how you sounded
- **Download the transcript** — Save a text file of the entire conversation for review

## Scripts Tab — Objection Handling Library

A library of scripts to help you handle common real estate objections.

### Script Categories

Scripts are organized by objection type:
- **Price objections** — "Your price is too high" / "I can get a better deal elsewhere"
- **Commission objections** — "Why should I pay that commission rate?"
- **Timing objections** — "I'm not ready to buy/sell right now"
- **Competition objections** — "Another agent offered me a better deal"
- **General objections** — Common pushback and how to handle it

### What's in Each Script

Every script includes:
- A clear description of the objection
- A recommended response framework
- Example dialogue showing how to handle it
- Tips and variations for different situations

### Exporting Scripts

Click **Export as PDF** to save any script as a formatted PDF. Great for reviewing before client meetings or printing out for your desk.

## Tips for Getting the Most from RolePlay

- **Start with beginner scenarios** — Build your confidence before tackling advanced objections
- **Practice regularly** — Even 10-15 minutes a week makes a noticeable difference in real conversations
- **Focus on one area at a time** — If your "Active Listening" score is low, work on that specifically before moving to other areas
- **Review your recordings** — Listening back is often more revealing than the scores alone
- **Use scripts before sessions** — Read through relevant scripts from the Scripts tab before practicing a scenario in that category
- **Track your progress** — Watch your scores improve over time in the Results tab
