## Voice Role-Play System

### How a Session Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Scenario">
    Choose a pre-built or custom scenario from the Search tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Call">
    The system initiates a voice call via ElevenLabs integration. The user's phone number (from their profile) receives the call.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Practice Conversation">
    The AI opponent plays the role defined in the scenario (e.g., skeptical buyer, price-sensitive seller). The user practices their sales techniques in real-time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Session Recording">
    The entire conversation is recorded and transcribed automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Analysis">
    After the session ends, AI analyzes the performance across multiple dimensions and provides scores and feedback.
  </Step>
</Steps>
