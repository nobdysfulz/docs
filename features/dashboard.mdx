The Dashboard is the first thing you see when you open PULSEIntel Pro. Think of it as your daily game plan — an AI-generated action list that tells you exactly what to focus on today to move your business forward.

## Your Daily Brief

At the top of the Dashboard, you'll see a summary card with your key numbers:
- **Your Intelligence Score** — Your overall PGIC performance score
- **Tasks completed today** — How many items you've knocked out
- **Goal progress** — A quick look at how you're tracking toward your production targets
- **Your streak** — How many consecutive days you've completed your tasks

## Your Task List

Every day, PULSEIntel Pro generates a personalized action plan based on your goals, pipeline, and past activity. You'll also see follow-up tasks from your CRM and any tasks you've created manually.

### How Tasks Are Organized

Your tasks are grouped by importance:
1. **Priority Tasks** — The most impactful items for today. Start here.
2. **Secondary Tasks** — Important but less urgent activities
3. **Completed Tasks** — Everything you've finished today

### Filtering Your Tasks

Use the filter buttons at the top to focus on what matters:
- **All** — See everything on your plate
- **Completed** — Review what you've accomplished
- **High Priority** — Focus on the most important items only
- **In Progress** — See tasks you've started but not finished

You can also use the **search bar** to find a specific task by name.

### What You Can Do with Each Task

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Complete** | Mark the task as done — you'll be asked to log the outcome (see below) |
| **Snooze** | Push the task to tomorrow if you can't get to it today |
| **Skip** | Remove the task from your list. PULSEIntel Pro may suggest a replacement. |
| **Start** | Mark the task as in progress so you can track what you're working on |

### Logging Outcomes

When you complete a task, a quick form pops up asking:
- **How did it go?** — Rate the interaction on a 1-5 scale
- **Leads generated** — How many new leads came from this activity?
- **Appointments set** — Did you book any appointments?
- **Notes** — Anything you want to remember about this interaction

<Tip>
Logging outcomes is one of the most valuable habits you can build. This data feeds directly into your Intelligence scores and goal tracking, giving you a clearer picture of what's working.

## Sidebar Panels

On the right side of your Dashboard (or accessible via the panel icon on mobile), you'll find helpful widgets:

### Insights Panel
A snapshot of today's performance:
- What percentage of your tasks you've completed
- Estimated productive time invested
- Progress toward your current goal deadlines

### Top Contacts
The contacts in your CRM who need your attention most, ranked by factors like:
- How long it's been since you last reached out
- Where they are in your pipeline
- Their deal value

### Relationship Maintenance
Contacts who haven't heard from you in a while. These are the people who might slip through the cracks without a quick check-in call or message.

### AI Coach
Personalized coaching tips based on your activity patterns and Intelligence scores. The AI Coach might suggest adjusting your daily approach or highlighting trends in your performance.

## Tips for Getting the Most from Your Dashboard

- **Check it every morning** — Make it the first thing you open. Your AI-generated plan is designed to prioritize what matters most today.
- **Complete tasks in order** — Priority tasks are ranked by impact. Working top-down ensures you're always focusing on what moves the needle.
- **Always log outcomes** — Even a quick note helps. The more data PULSEIntel Pro has, the smarter your future action plans become.
- **Don't ignore the sidebar** — The Top Contacts and Relationship Maintenance widgets catch things your task list might miss.
