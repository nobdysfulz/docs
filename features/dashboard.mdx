The Dashboard is the default landing page (`/ToDo`) and serves as the daily command center. It displays AI-generated tasks, performance summaries, and actionable insights.

## Page Layout

The page uses a two-column layout on desktop:
- **Main content area** - Daily brief card, task list with filtering
- **Right sidebar** - Insights panel, top contacts, relationship maintenance, AI coach

On mobile, a dedicated `MobileHomePage` component renders with a simplified layout and pull-to-refresh support.

## Daily Brief Card

At the top of the page, a summary card shows:
- **PGIC Score** - Your current Pulse Graph Intelligence Core composite score
- **Tasks completed** - Count of finished tasks for the day
- **Goal progress** - High-level progress toward production goals
- **Streak** - Consecutive days of task completion

## Task Management

### Task Sources

Tasks are generated from multiple sources:
- **AI-generated daily actions** - Created by the `generateDailyTasks` function based on your production plan, goals, and preferences
- **CRM follow-ups** - Contact-related tasks from CRM activities
- **Manual tasks** - User-created tasks

### Task Properties

Each task (`DailyAction` entity) includes:
- **Title and description** - What needs to be done
- **Priority** - High, medium, or low
- **Status** - Pending, in progress, completed, skipped, snoozed
- **Action type** - Call, email, social media, meeting, admin, etc.
- **Linked contact** - Optional CRM contact association
- **Scheduled time** - When the task should be performed

### Task Filtering

Tasks can be filtered by:
- **All** - Shows all pending and in-progress tasks
- **Completed** - Shows finished tasks
- **High Priority** - Only high-priority items
- **In Progress** - Currently active tasks

A search field allows filtering by task title or description.

### Task Organization

Tasks are displayed in collapsible groups:
1. **Priority Tasks** - High-priority items, expanded by default
2. **Secondary Tasks** - Medium and low priority items
3. **Completed Tasks** - Shown with reduced opacity

### Task Actions

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Complete** | Opens an outcome capture modal, then marks the task as done |
| **Snooze** | Postpones the task to tomorrow |
| **Skip** | Marks as skipped and optionally generates a replacement task |
| **Start** | Marks the task as in-progress |

### Outcome Capture

When completing a task, a modal collects:
- **Rating** - How the interaction went (1-5 scale)
- **Leads generated** - Number of new leads from this activity
- **Appointments set** - Number of appointments booked
- **Notes** - Free-text outcome description

This data feeds into your PULSE score and goal tracking.

## Sidebar Widgets

### Insights Panel

Displays key performance metrics:
- **Completion rate** - Percentage of today's tasks completed
- **Time invested** - Estimated hours of productive work
- **Goal progress** - Current progress toward nearest goal deadline

### Top Contacts Widget

Shows the highest-priority contacts from your CRM who need attention. Contacts are scored based on:
- Last contact date
- Pipeline stage
- Deal value
- Activity frequency

### Relationship Maintenance Widget

Highlights contacts in your database that haven't been contacted recently and may need a check-in to maintain the relationship.

### AI Coach Panel

Provides context-aware coaching powered by your PGIC data:
- Behavioral insights from PULSE scoring
- Suggested improvements
- Performance trends

## Data Flow

The Dashboard loads data from multiple sources on mount:
1. `DailyAction` entities filtered by user and date
2. `CrmContact` data for contact widgets
3. `CrmActivity` records for scoring
4. PGIC data via the `usePGICData` hook
5. User goals from `UserContext`

Data refreshes when the user returns to the tab (via React Query's `refetchOnWindowFocus`).
