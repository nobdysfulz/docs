The Marketing Hub is your central command for planning and executing your marketing strategy. It combines a content calendar, AI content creation, campaign management, and template library in one place.

## Getting There

Click **Marketing Hub** in the left sidebar. You'll see four tabs: **Overview**, **AI Creator**, **Recents**, and **Preferences**.

## Overview

The Overview gives you a snapshot of your marketing activity for today and the month ahead.

### Today's Focus

On the left side, you'll see what's on your marketing plate today:

- **Today's Content Template** — If there's a scheduled content topic for today, it's shown here with a **Copy** button (to grab the topic) and a **Generate** button (to create AI content around it)
- **Calendar Items** — Any social posts, emails, or campaign steps scheduled for today
- **Active Campaigns** — Campaigns currently in progress with a link to view details

### Content Calendar

On the right side, a full **monthly calendar** shows your marketing schedule at a glance:
- **Blue badges** — Recurring content topics (like "Market Update Monday" or "Tip Tuesday")
- **Purple badges** — Specific content items or events you've scheduled
- **Today** is highlighted with a border so you can spot it easily

**To add something to the calendar:**
1. Click on any date
2. Fill in the details (content topic, type, linked template or campaign)
3. Click **Save**

**To edit or delete an entry:**
1. Click on the entry in the calendar
2. Make your changes or click **Delete**
3. Click **Save**

### Recent Content

Below Today's Focus, you'll see your last 3 generated content items. Click any to view the full content.

### Quick Access

Two cards at the top link you to:
- **Templates** — Browse your library of social post and email templates
- **Campaigns** — Manage your marketing campaigns

## AI Creator

The AI Creator tab gives you a full content generation tool:

1. Enter your **topic** or select from suggestions
2. Choose the **platform** you're creating for
3. Set your preferred **tone** and **length**
4. Click **Generate**
5. Preview the content, then copy or save it

The AI Creator uses your market data to make content relevant to your local area.

## Recents

View all your recently generated content in one list:
- See the content type, title, and creation date for each item
- Click any item to view the full content
- Your last 20 generated items are saved here

## Preferences

Set your default content preferences:
- **Default Tone** — Professional, casual, educational, or promotional
- **Default Length** — Short, medium, or long

These defaults apply to all content generation across both the Marketing Hub and Content Studio.

## Marketing Hub vs. Content Studio

Both tools create AI-generated content, but they serve different purposes:

| | Marketing Hub | Content Studio |
|--|--------------|---------------|
| **Best for** | Planning and scheduling your marketing | Quick, on-demand content creation |
| **Calendar** | Full monthly view with scheduling | Weekly view organized by topic |
| **Campaigns** | Campaign tracking and management | Not included |
| **Templates** | Template library access | Content pack library |

<Tip>
Use the Marketing Hub for your weekly marketing planning sessions. Schedule your content topics on the calendar at the start of each week, then use the AI Creator or Content Studio to generate the actual content when it's time to post.
