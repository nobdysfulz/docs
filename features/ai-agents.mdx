### Call History View
The main content area displays a paginated table of call logs with:
- Contact phone number and name

- Call status (completed, appointment_set, failed, initiated)
- Recording duration

Clicking a call log row opens `CallDetailSidebar` showing:

The right sidebar shows `CallMetrics` with aggregate statistics across all calls.

## SIRIUS - Content Agent

SIRIUS specializes in marketing content creation through the same chat interface.

## Agent Guidelines

Each agent has configurable guidelines via `GuidelinesPanel` that control:
- Response tone and formality
- Industry-specific terminology preferences
- Business context to include in responses
- Behavioral boundaries

Guidelines are stored per agent type and user, allowing personalization of each agent's behavior.

## Session Management

- Agent conversations use the `sessionCache` system with context keys like `{agentType}_context`
- Switching between agents clears the previous agent's session cache
- The URL updates with `?tab={agentId}` for direct linking to specific agents
- Scroll position resets to top when switching agents

## Onboarding Gates

The page enforces two onboarding gates:
1. **Agent Onboarding** - Required before any agent use. Redirects to `AgentOnboardingFlow` if `agentOnboardingCompleted` is false.
2. **Call Center Onboarding** - Required for PHOENIX. Triggered when accessing the `leads_agent` tab with `?onboarding=true` if `callCenterOnboardingCompleted` is false.
