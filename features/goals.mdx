The Goals page helps you set production targets and track your progress toward them in real time. It takes the guesswork out of knowing whether you're on pace for the year.

## Getting There

Click **Goals** in the left sidebar. You'll see three tabs across the top: **Tracking**, **Insights**, and **Planner**.

## Tracking Tab

This is your main goals view, showing everything at a glance.

### Your Key Numbers

At the top, you'll see six performance cards:
- **Total Pipeline Value** — The combined value of all deals in your pipeline
- **Total GCI** — Your gross commission income across all pipeline contacts
- **Total Contacts** — How many contacts are in your CRM
- **Year Closed Volume** — Total value of deals you've closed this year
- **Year Closed Units** — Number of deals closed this year
- **Year In-Contract Volume** — Value of deals currently under contract

### Goal Progress Overview

Four summary cards give you the big picture:
- **Overall Progress** — A weighted average across all your active goals
- **Year-to-Date GCI** — Where you are vs. your annual income target
- **Quarterly Progress** — How you're doing on goals due this quarter
- **Year-End Pace** — Are you ahead or behind where you should be at this point in the year?

### Your Production Goals

Your four main production targets are displayed with progress bars:
- **Total GCI** — Your annual income goal
- **Total Buyers Closed** — Number of buyer deals to close
- **Total Listings Closed** — Number of listing deals to close
- **Total Sales Volume** — Total dollar volume target

Each goal shows:
- A progress bar showing how far you've come
- A status badge: **On Track** (green), **Slightly Behind** (yellow), or **At Risk** (red)
- A **confidence score** — your estimated probability of hitting the goal based on your current pace and historical performance
- An AI-recommended next step
- An **Update Progress** button

### Activity Drivers

Below your production goals, you'll see your top activity goals — things like calls made, appointments set, or open houses held — with progress bars.

### Performance Chart

A line chart comparing your **expected pace** (where you should be based on time elapsed) with your **actual progress** month by month.

## Insights Tab

Click the **Insights** tab to get AI-powered analysis of your goal trajectory:

- **Performance Analysis** — A summary of how you're doing and what the data says
- **Recommended Actions** — Specific things you can do this week to get back on track (or stay ahead)
- **Weekly Focus** — The single most important area to concentrate on

Click the **refresh button** to generate fresh insights at any time.

## Planner Tab

The **Production Planner** is where you set up (or adjust) your annual targets. It works by reverse-engineering your income goal:

1. Enter your **annual income target**
2. Set your **average commission rate** and **average deal size**
3. The planner automatically calculates:
   - How many total deals you need
   - How many buyer and listing deals
   - Monthly and weekly activity targets
   - Required appointments, contacts, and lead sources

This gives you a clear daily and weekly "number" to hit, removing the guesswork from your business planning.

## Goal Categories

PULSEIntel Pro organizes goals into four categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Production** | Total GCI, closed volume, units sold, average sale price |
| **Activity** | Calls made, appointments set, open houses held, emails sent |
| **Marketing** | Social media posts, database touches, listing presentations |
| **Personal Development** | Training hours, role-play sessions, courses completed |

A healthy goal plan includes goals from multiple categories — production goals tell you what to achieve, while activity goals tell you how to get there.

## Setting SMART Goals

The most effective goals are **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound**:

| Element | What It Means | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Specific** | Clear target with no ambiguity | "Close 24 buyer transactions" not "sell more homes" |
| **Measurable** | A number you can track | "24 transactions" |
| **Achievable** | Realistic given your market and capacity | Based on your historical conversion rates |
| **Relevant** | Tied to your larger income goal | 24 transactions × average commission = your GCI goal |
| **Time-bound** | Has a deadline | "By December 31" |

## Breaking Down Annual Goals to Daily Tasks

Your annual goals automatically drive your daily task list on the Dashboard:

1. Set your annual production goal in the Planner
2. The planner calculates monthly, weekly, and daily targets
3. These targets generate daily tasks (calls to make, appointments to set, etc.) on your Dashboard
4. Each day, complete your tasks and log outcomes
5. Your goal progress updates automatically

This Daily Pulse keeps you focused on the right activities every day, not just the big-picture numbers.

## Managing Your Goals

### Adding a New Goal
1. Click the **Add Goal** button
2. Choose a category: **Production**, **Activity**, **Marketing**, or **Personal Development**
3. Set your target value, unit, and deadline
4. Optionally set a confidence target (how likely you expect to hit it)
5. Click **Save**

### Updating Your Progress
1. Click **Update Progress** on any goal
2. Enter your new numbers
3. Optionally link the update to a CRM contact or transaction for verification
4. Click **Save**

### Goal Templates

Not sure where to start? Use a pre-built template:
- **New Agent** — Conservative targets for agents in their first 1-2 years
- **Growth** — Mid-range targets for established agents scaling their business
- **Top Producer** — Aggressive targets for high-volume producers

Select a template and customize the numbers to fit your market and experience level.

### Syncing from Your CRM
If you've connected an external CRM (Lofty or Follow Up Boss):
1. Click the **Sync from CRM** button
2. PULSEIntel Pro pulls your latest data and updates matching goals automatically

This also works with the built-in CRM — activities and closed deals you track there are synced to your goals.

<Tip>
Syncing from CRM is the easiest way to keep your goals accurate. If you're logging your deals and activities in the CRM, your goals will update themselves.
