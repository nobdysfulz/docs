The Intelligence page (`/Intelligence`) is the business analytics dashboard powered by the **Pulse Graph Intelligence Core (PGIC)**. It provides composite scoring across three dimensions, trend analysis, AI insights, and performance forecasting.

## PGIC Scoring System

The PGIC system calculates an **Overall Intelligence Score** (0-100) as a composite of three sub-scores:

### PULSE - Execution & Consistency

Measures daily execution habits and goal progress:
- Task completion rates
- Activity consistency (streaks, daily engagement)
- Goal progression velocity

**Detailed views include:**
- `ActivityHeatmap` - Visual heatmap of daily activity patterns
- `ConsistencyTrend` - Line chart of consistency over time
- `ExecutionBreakdown` - Breakdown of execution metrics by category

### GANE - Predictability & System Usage

Tracks how effectively the user leverages platform tools:
- Feature adoption rates
- Automation utilization
- System engagement depth

**Detailed views include:**
- `SystemUsageMetrics` - Platform feature usage statistics
- `AutomationUtilization` - Automation adoption and effectiveness

### MORO - Market Opportunity

Analyzes market conditions in the user's territory:
- Local market dynamics
- Supply/demand indicators
- Price trend analysis
- Competitive positioning

**Detailed views include:**
- `MarketSnapshot` - Current market conditions summary
- `PerformanceVsMarket` - User performance compared to market averages

## Page Layout

- **Contextual Top Nav** - Four tabs: Overview, PULSE Details, GANE Details, MORO Details
- **Action button** - Refresh button with "last updated" timestamp
- **Main content area** - Tab-specific dashboards

On mobile, the `MobileAnalyticsPage` component renders with only the Overview tab.

### Score Cards Row

### Learning Mode Banner

If no activity data has been collected yet (`hasMinimalData()` returns false), an info banner explains that the system is gathering data and scores will appear once enough actions are logged.

### Trend Chart

The `TrendChart` component shows historical score progression over time for all three sub-scores.

### AI Insights & Recommendations

The `InsightsFeed` component displays AI-generated insights categorized by:
- **Behavior** insights - Link to the ToDo page for action
- **System** insights - Link to Settings for configuration
- **Market** insights - Informational market analysis

Each insight has an optional action button that navigates to the relevant page.

### Forecast Card

The `ForecastCard` shows predictive analytics:

- Business plan integration (if available)
- Goal metrics (GCI target/current, deals target/current)

## Data Fetching

Intelligence data is loaded via the `usePGICData` custom hook:

```
usePGICData(userId) → {
  data: { scores, insights, forecast },
  loading,
  error,
  lastRefreshed,
  refreshing,
  refresh
}
```

The hook manages:
- Initial data loading
- Manual refresh with loading state
- Error handling
- Last refresh timestamp tracking

## Business Plan Integration

The page also loads the active `BusinessPlan` for the user to provide context for forecasting:
- Annual GCI targets
