The Intelligence page shows you how your business is performing through three key scores that together form your **PGIC Intelligence Score** — a comprehensive measure of your execution, system usage, and market opportunity.

## Getting There

Click **Intelligence** in the left sidebar. You'll see four tabs: **Overview**, **PULSE Details**, **GANE Details**, and **MORO Details**.

## Your Intelligence Score

Your overall Intelligence Score (0-100) is a combination of three components:

### PULSE — Execution & Consistency

**What it measures:** How consistently you show up and complete your daily tasks.

Your PULSE score improves when you:
- Complete dashboard tasks daily
- Maintain your streak of consecutive active days
- Make steady progress toward your goals
- Log outcomes after activities

### GANE — Predictability & System Usage

**What it measures:** How well you're using the tools PULSEIntel Pro provides.

Your GANE score improves when you:
- Use multiple features of the platform regularly
- Set up automations in your CRM
- Use templates and campaigns
- Keep your CRM, goals, and settings up to date

### MORO — Market Opportunity

**What it measures:** The strength of your market position and local opportunity.

Your MORO score reflects:
- Local market conditions in your territory
- Supply and demand dynamics
- Price trends in your area
- How your activity compares to market averages

## Overview Tab

The Overview gives you the full picture:

- **Overall Score** — Your composite Intelligence Score displayed in a large circular graphic with a trend arrow showing if you're improving or declining
- **Three Score Cards** — Individual PULSE, GANE, and MORO scores with trend indicators
- **Trend Chart** — A graph showing how all three scores have changed over time
- **AI Insights** — Personalized recommendations in three categories:
  - **Behavior insights** — Suggestions for improving your daily habits
  - **System insights** — Tips for using PULSEIntel Pro more effectively
  - **Market insights** — Analysis of your local market conditions
- **Forecast** — A prediction of your growth trajectory, including projected scores and goal completion probability

<Note>
If you're brand new to PULSEIntel Pro, you'll see a "Learning Mode" banner. The system needs a few days of activity data before it can calculate meaningful scores. Keep using the platform and your scores will appear soon.
