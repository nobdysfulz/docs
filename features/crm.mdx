The built-in CRM keeps all your contacts, deals, and communications organized. It's designed specifically for real estate, so it understands pipeline stages, transaction values, and the way agents actually manage relationships.

## Getting There

Click **CRM** in the left sidebar. You'll see tabs across the top for different views.

## Contacts

Your main contact list shows everyone in your database.

### Viewing Contacts
- Contacts are displayed in a table with name, phone, email, status, and pipeline stage
- Click any contact to see their full details in the right panel
- Use the **search bar** to find contacts by name, email, or phone number
- **Filter** by lead status or pipeline stage to narrow your view

### Adding a Contact
1. Click **Add Contact**
2. Fill in their information (name, email, phone, etc.)
3. Set their lead status and pipeline stage
4. Click **Save**

### Importing Contacts in Bulk
If you have a list of contacts in a spreadsheet:
1. Click the **Import** button
2. Upload your CSV file
3. Map your columns to PULSEIntel Pro fields
4. Click **Import**

### Contact Details
Click any contact to see their full profile in the right panel:
- **Contact info** — Name, email, phone, and all details (you can edit right here)
- **Activity timeline** — A history of every interaction with this contact
- **Notes** — Add and view notes
- **Tags** — Organize contacts with custom labels
- **Linked transactions** — Any deals associated with this contact

## Pipeline

The Pipeline view shows your deals as a visual board:

- Each column represents a **stage** in your sales process (New Lead, Contacted, Qualifying, Under Contract, Closed, etc.)
- Each card represents a contact with their deal value
- **Drag and drop** contacts between stages as deals progress
- See at a glance how many deals are in each stage and their total value

<Tip>
The Pipeline view is the fastest way to get a snapshot of your business. Check it weekly to make sure no deals are stuck in a stage too long.
