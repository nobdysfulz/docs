The built-in CRM keeps all your contacts, deals, and communications organized. It's designed specifically for real estate, so it understands pipeline stages, transaction values, and the way agents actually manage relationships.

## Getting There

Click **CRM** in the left sidebar. You'll see tabs across the top for different views.

## Contacts

Your main contact list shows everyone in your database.

### Viewing Contacts
- Contacts are displayed in a table with name, phone, email, status, and pipeline stage
- Click any contact to see their full details in the right panel
- Use the **search bar** to find contacts by name, email, or phone number
- **Filter** by lead status, pipeline stage, tags, or other criteria to narrow your view

### Adding a Contact
1. Click **Add Contact**
2. Fill in their information (name, email, phone, etc.)
3. Set their lead status and pipeline stage
4. Click **Save**

### Importing Contacts in Bulk

If you have a list of contacts in a spreadsheet:
1. Click the **Import** button
2. Upload your CSV file (.csv format — if you have an Excel file, save it as CSV first)
3. Map your columns to PULSEIntel Pro fields (match "First Name" in your file to the First Name field, etc.)
4. Preview the import to confirm everything looks right
5. Click **Import**

<Note>
CSV files must have at least a name column to import. Files larger than 500 contacts should be split into smaller batches to avoid timeouts. Special characters in your file may cause import errors — remove or replace them if the import fails.
</Note>

### Contact Details
Click any contact to see their full profile in the right panel:
- **Contact info** — Name, email, phone, and all details (editable inline)
- **Custom fields** — Additional fields specific to your business (buyer timeline, price range, property type preferences, etc.)
- **Activity timeline** — A history of every interaction with this contact
- **Notes** — Add and view notes about the relationship
- **Tags** — Organize contacts with custom labels for easy filtering
- **Linked transactions** — Any deals associated with this contact

### Organizing Contacts

Keep your database clean and actionable:
- **Tags** — Add custom labels to group contacts (e.g., "sphere of influence," "hot buyer," "past client")
- **Lead Status** — Track where a contact is in your funnel (New, Active, Nurture, Closed, Archive)
- **Search & Filter** — Combine search and filters to build targeted lists for outreach

## Pipeline

The Pipeline view shows your deals as a visual board:

- Each column represents a **stage** in your sales process (New Lead, Contacted, Qualifying, Under Contract, Closed, etc.)
- Each card represents a contact with their deal value
- **Drag and drop** contacts between stages as deals progress
- See at a glance how many deals are in each stage and their total value

<Tip>
The Pipeline view is the fastest way to get a snapshot of your business. Check it weekly to make sure no deals are stuck in a stage too long.
</Tip>

## Conversations

Manage all your communications with contacts in one place:
- **SMS** — View and send text messages to any contact
- **Email** — Read and compose email threads linked to your contacts
- **Voice** — Review call history and listen to recordings

All incoming and outgoing messages are logged automatically to the contact's activity timeline.

## Activities

Log every interaction with your contacts to maintain an accurate relationship history.

### Activity Types

| Activity | When to Use |
|----------|------------|
| **Call** | Phone conversations, voicemails left |
| **Email** | Emails sent or received |
| **Meeting** | In-person or video meetings |

### Logging an Activity

**Quick log:**
1. Click the contact
2. Click **Log Activity** in the right panel
3. Select the activity type
4. Add a note and any outcome
5. Click **Save**

**From a task:** If you complete a task tied to a contact, you can log the outcome directly from the task.

### Automatic Activity Logging

Activities logged through other parts of PULSEIntel Pro sync to your contacts automatically:
- **PHOENIX calls** — Inbound and outbound calls are logged with recording links
- **Conversations** (SMS/email) — Messages sent through the Conversations tab are logged
- **Task completions** — When you mark dashboard tasks done, the activity is recorded

## Transactions

Track your deals from contract to close.

### Creating a Transaction
1. Click **Transactions** at the top of the CRM
2. Click **New Transaction**
3. Enter the property address and deal details
4. Link the transaction to a contact (buyer or seller)
5. Set the expected closing date and commission amount
6. Click **Save**

### Transaction Details

Each transaction has a dedicated view with:
- **Property info** — Address, type, list price, and sale price
- **Timeline** — Key dates (contract date, inspection deadline, financing deadline, closing date)
- **Parties** — Buyer, seller, co-op agent, title company, lender, and other parties involved
- **Tasks & checklists** — Action items to complete before closing (inspection, appraisal, document collection, etc.)
- **Notes** — Running notes on the deal
- **Commission tracking** — Projected and actual commission amounts

### Transaction Stages

Move transactions through stages as the deal progresses:
- Pre-Contract
- Under Contract
- Inspection Period
- Financing Contingency
- Clear to Close
- Closed
- Cancelled

### Checklists

Each transaction stage can have a checklist of required tasks. Check off items as you complete them to make sure nothing falls through the cracks before closing.

## Tasks

Create and manage follow-up tasks tied to specific contacts:
- Set due dates and priority levels
- Track completion status
- Tasks tied to contacts appear on the contact's activity timeline
- Overdue tasks surface on your Dashboard so you never miss a follow-up

## Insights

View analytics about your CRM activity:
- **Engagement scoring** — See which contacts are most engaged
- **Pipeline velocity** — How fast deals move through your stages
- **Conversion rates** — Your success rate at each stage

## Automations

- Configure lead assignment rules for teams

## Templates

- Create your own custom templates
- Use smart variables like `{{first_name}}` and `{{address}}` that fill in automatically
- Organize templates by category for quick access
