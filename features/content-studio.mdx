- **Target Audience** - Audience description for tone calibration

Preferences are stored in the `ContentPreference` entity.

## AI Content Generation

### How It Works

Content generation uses GPT-4o via the `openaiChat` backend function:

1. User selects content type and topic
2. System loads the appropriate `AiPromptConfig` (system and user message templates)
3. Market intelligence data is injected for localized content
4. User preferences (tone, length) are applied
5. AI generates content
6. Result is saved to `GeneratedContent` entity

### Prompt Configuration

Prompts are managed via the `AiPromptConfig` entity:
- `promptId` - Unique identifier (e.g., `content_studio_social_post`)
- `systemMessage` - System prompt defining AI behavior
- `userMessageTemplate` - User prompt with `{{platform}}`, `{{topic}}` placeholders
- `isActive` - Whether the config is currently in use

### Market Context

If market intelligence data is available (`MarketIntelligence` entity), it's injected into prompts:
- Local market statistics
- Neighborhood information
- Price trends
- Competitive landscape data

This ensures generated content is relevant to the user's specific market.

## Credit System

Content generation may consume credits depending on the subscription tier:
- Credit balance is displayed in the top banner
- Generation is blocked if insufficient credits remain
- Credits are tracked per generation via the `creditsUsed` field
- Subscriber tier users may have unlimited generation
