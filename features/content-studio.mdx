The Content Studio is your AI-powered content creation tool. It generates ready-to-use social media posts, email scripts, phone scripts, and text messages — all tailored to your market, brand voice, and preferences.

## Getting There

Click **Content Studio** in the left sidebar. You'll see four tabs: **Create & Post**, **Calendar**, **Recents**, and **Preferences**.

## Create & Post

This is where the magic happens. You have two ways to generate content:

### Weekly Content Packs

PULSEIntel Pro organizes content topics by day of the week. Each day has a themed pack that includes:
- **Social media post** — Ready to copy and paste to your platforms
- **Email script** — A professional email you can send to your database
- **Phone script** — Talking points for calls
- **Text/DM template** — Short messages for texts or direct messages

Click on any day's pack to generate fresh content for that topic. Don't like what was generated? Click **Regenerate** for a new version.

### Ready-to-Use Packs

Browse curated content collections created by our team. These are pre-built packs around popular real estate topics:
- Click any pack to preview it in the right panel
- Click **Generate** to create content from the pack
- Some premium packs are available only on paid plans

## Calendar

A weekly view showing your content schedule:
- See which topics are planned for each day
- Click on a day to generate that day's content
- Drag topics around to rearrange your schedule

## Recents

View all content you've recently generated:
- Browse by content type (social post, email, phone script, etc.)
- Click any item to see the full content
- Copy content to your clipboard for easy sharing

## Preferences

Set your default content generation preferences so every piece of content matches your style:

- **Tone** — Professional, casual, educational, or promotional
- **Length** — Short, medium, or long
- **Market Focus** — Your primary territory for localized content
- **Target Audience** — Who you're speaking to

<Tip>
Setting your preferences saves you time on every generation. Do this once and your content will consistently match your brand voice.

## Types of Content You Can Create

| Content Type | What It Is | Best For |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Social Media Post** | Platform-ready post with caption | Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn |
| **Email Script** | Professional email body | Database nurturing, follow-ups |
| **Phone Script** | Call talking points | Prospecting calls, check-ins |
| **Text/DM Template** | Short direct message | Quick outreach, responses |
| **Blog Post** | Long-form article | Website content, SEO |
| **Listing Description** | Property description | MLS listings, marketing materials |

## How AI Content Generation Works

When you generate content, PULSEIntel Pro:
1. Takes your selected topic and content type
2. Applies your tone and length preferences
3. Incorporates your **market data** (local statistics, neighborhood info) so content is relevant to your area
4. Creates unique, personalized content in seconds

The more you use Content Studio, the better it gets at matching your style.

## Credits

Content generation uses credits from your account:
- Your credit balance is shown at the top of the Content Studio
- Each generation consumes a small number of credits
- Your subscription includes a monthly credit allocation
- Need more? You can purchase additional credits in [Billing](/account/billing)

If you're running low on credits, you'll see a warning before generating.

## Tips for Great Content

- **Personalize before posting** — AI content is a great starting point. Add a personal touch, local detail, or your own experience before sharing.
- **Be consistent** — Use the weekly packs to post something every day. Consistency is key for building your online presence.
- **Match the platform** — A LinkedIn post should feel different from an Instagram caption. Adjust the tone for each platform.
- **Save what works** — When a post gets great engagement, note what made it resonate and ask for more like it.
