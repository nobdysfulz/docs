The Content Studio is your AI-powered content creation tool. It generates ready-to-use social media posts, email scripts, phone scripts, and text messages — all tailored to your market, brand voice, and preferences.

## Getting There

Click **Content Studio** in the left sidebar. You'll see four tabs: **Create & Post**, **Calendar**, **Recents**, and **Preferences**.

## Create & Post

This is where the magic happens. You have two ways to generate content:

### Weekly Content Packs

PULSEIntel Pro organizes content topics by day of the week. Each day has a themed pack that includes:
- **Social media post** — Ready to copy and paste to your platforms
- **Email script** — A professional email you can send to your database
- **Phone script** — Talking points for calls
- **Text/DM template** — Short messages for texts or direct messages

Click on any day's pack to generate fresh content for that topic. Don't like what was generated? Click **Regenerate** for a new version.

### Ready-to-Use Packs

Browse curated content collections created by our team. These are pre-built packs around popular real estate topics:
- Click any pack to preview it in the right panel
- Click **Generate** to create content from the pack
- Some premium packs are available only on paid plans

## Calendar

Your content calendar gives you a visual view of your posting schedule and helps you plan ahead:

- **Color-coded by platform** — Quickly see which posts are going to Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other connected platforms
- **Schedule posts** — Click any day on the calendar to schedule content for that date
- **Bulk scheduling** — Generate and schedule a week or month of posts at once to stay consistent without daily effort
- **Drag to reschedule** — Move scheduled posts to different days by dragging them on the calendar
- **Manage scheduled posts** — Click any scheduled post to edit, reschedule, or delete it before it goes out

### Connecting Your Social Media Accounts

To publish directly from Content Studio, connect your social media accounts:

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations**
2. Click **Connect** next to each platform you want to link (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Business, etc.)
3. Authorize the connection in the pop-up window
4. Return to Content Studio — your connected accounts will appear when scheduling posts

<Tip>
Connect at least one social account to unlock direct publishing. Without a connected account, you can still generate content and copy it manually.
</Tip>

### Scheduling a Post

1. Generate content using a weekly pack or ready-to-use pack
2. Click **Schedule** on the content you want to post
3. Choose your platform(s)
4. Select the date and time
5. Click **Confirm**

### Cross-Platform Posting

Post the same content to multiple platforms at once:
- Select multiple connected accounts when scheduling
- Each platform receives a version optimized for its format and character limits

### Recycling Content

High-performing posts can be reshared on a schedule:
- Click the **recycle** option on any past post
- Set how often you want it to reappear in your calendar
- Great for evergreen content like market tips or buyer/seller advice

## Recents

View all content you've recently generated:
- Browse by content type (social post, email, phone script, etc.)
- Click any item to see the full content
- Copy content to your clipboard for easy sharing
- Track post performance for content you've published directly from Content Studio

## Preferences

Set your default content generation preferences so every piece of content matches your style:

- **Tone** — Professional, casual, educational, or promotional
- **Length** — Short, medium, or long
- **Market Focus** — Your primary territory for localized content
- **Target Audience** — Who you're speaking to

### Brand Voice Training

The more you use Content Studio, the better it learns your style. You can actively train it by:
- Rating generated content (thumbs up/down) to signal what works for your voice
- Editing generated content — your changes help the AI understand your preferences
- Updating your **Guidelines** in the SIRIUS agent tab for deeper customization

<Tip>
Setting your preferences saves you time on every generation. Do this once and your content will consistently match your brand voice.
</Tip>

## Types of Content You Can Create

| Content Type | What It Is | Best For |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Social Media Post** | Platform-ready post with caption | Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn |
| **Email Script** | Professional email body | Database nurturing, follow-ups |
| **Phone Script** | Call talking points | Prospecting calls, check-ins |
| **Text/DM Template** | Short direct message | Quick outreach, responses |
| **Blog Post** | Long-form article | Website content, SEO |
| **Listing Description** | Property description | MLS listings, marketing materials |

## How AI Content Generation Works

When you generate content, PULSEIntel Pro:
1. Takes your selected topic and content type
2. Applies your tone and length preferences
3. Incorporates your **market data** (local statistics, neighborhood info) so content is relevant to your area
4. Creates unique, personalized content in seconds

## Credits

Content generation uses credits from your account:
- Your credit balance is shown at the top of the Content Studio
- Each generation consumes a small number of credits
- Your subscription includes a monthly credit allocation
- Need more? You can purchase additional credits in [Billing](/account/billing)

If you're running low on credits, you'll see a warning before generating.

## Tips for Great Content

- **Personalize before posting** — AI content is a great starting point. Add a personal touch, local detail, or your own experience before sharing.
- **Be consistent** — Use the weekly packs to post something every day. Consistency is key for building your online presence.
- **Match the platform** — A LinkedIn post should feel different from an Instagram caption. Adjust the tone for each platform.
- **Batch your content** — Use the calendar to schedule a full week of posts in one sitting, then let it run on autopilot.
- **Save what works** — When a post gets great engagement, note what made it resonate and ask for more like it.
