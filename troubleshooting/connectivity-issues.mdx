PULSEIntel Pro is a web-based application that requires an active internet connection. If you're experiencing connectivity problems, this guide will help.

## How to Tell If It's a Connection Issue

You may have a connectivity problem if:
- Pages load slowly or show a spinning indicator that never stops
- You see error messages like "Network error," "Failed to load," or "Connection lost"
- Some parts of the page load but data areas remain blank
- Actions (like saving a contact or generating content) fail with an error
- The page appears to freeze or become unresponsive

## Basic Troubleshooting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Your Internet Connection">
    Try loading another website (like google.com) to confirm your internet is working. If other sites are also slow or not loading, the issue is with your internet connection, not PULSEIntel Pro.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refresh the Page">
    Press **F5** (or **Cmd + R** on Mac) to reload the page. Many temporary connection hiccups are resolved by a simple refresh.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait and Try Again">
    If PULSEIntel Pro was loading fine earlier and suddenly stopped, there may be a temporary server issue. Wait a minute and try refreshing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Your Wi-Fi or Cellular Signal">
    If you're on Wi-Fi, try moving closer to your router or switching to cellular data. If you're on cellular, check that you have adequate signal strength.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Your Browser">
    Close all browser tabs, quit the browser completely, and reopen it. This clears temporary memory issues that can affect page loading.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Slow Performance

**What's happening:** PULSEIntel Pro loads but everything feels sluggish — pages take a long time, clicks feel delayed, and content generation is slow.

**Common causes and fixes:**

| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Slow internet connection | Switch to a faster network or move closer to your Wi-Fi router |
| Too many browser tabs open | Close tabs you're not using to free up memory |
| Outdated browser | Update to the latest version of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge |
| Browser extensions | Try disabling extensions — some can slow down web apps significantly |
| VPN connection | If you're using a VPN, try disconnecting it. VPNs can add latency. |

## Data Not Saving

**What's happening:** You make changes (like editing a contact or updating a goal) but they don't seem to stick.

**Try these steps:**
1. **Check for error messages** — Look for a red error notification that may appear briefly at the top or bottom of the screen
2. **Refresh and check** — Refresh the page and see if your changes were actually saved. Sometimes the confirmation message just doesn't appear due to a connection blip.
3. **Check your connection** — A dropped connection during a save can cause data loss. Make sure you have a stable connection before making changes.
4. **Try again** — Re-enter your changes and click Save again

## Mobile-Specific Issues

### App Feels Slow on My Phone
- **Close other apps** — Free up your phone's memory by closing apps running in the background
- **Use Wi-Fi when possible** — Mobile data can be inconsistent, especially indoors
- **Clear browser cache** — Go to your browser settings > Clear browsing data > Cached images and files

### Pull-to-Refresh Not Working
- Make sure you're scrolled to the very top of the page before pulling down
- Pull from the content area, not from the navigation bar
- If it still doesn't work, use the refresh button in your browser instead

### Page Looks Broken on Mobile
- **Rotate your screen** — Sometimes switching between portrait and landscape fixes layout issues
- **Clear cache** — Old cached styles can cause display problems after updates
- **Update your browser** — Make sure you're running the latest version

## Browser-Specific Issues

### Chrome
- Make sure you're on the latest version (Menu > Help > About Google Chrome)
- Try disabling extensions one by one to find if one is causing issues
- Clear cache: Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data

### Safari
- Make sure you're on the latest macOS/iOS version
- Clear cache: Safari > Settings > Privacy > Manage Website Data
- Check that JavaScript is enabled: Safari > Settings > Security > Enable JavaScript

### Firefox
- Clear cache: Settings > Privacy & Security > Cookies and Site Data > Clear Data
- Try Safe Mode (Help > Troubleshoot Mode) to see if extensions are causing the issue

### Edge
- Make sure you're on the latest version
- Clear cache: Settings > Privacy, search, and services > Clear browsing data
