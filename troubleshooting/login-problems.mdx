PULSEIntel Pro uses **Google Sign-In** for authentication. If you're having trouble signing in, this guide will help you resolve common issues.

## "Sign in with Google" Button Doesn't Work

**Try these steps:**
1. **Check your internet connection** — You need an active internet connection to sign in
2. **Enable JavaScript** — Google Sign-In requires JavaScript to be enabled in your browser
3. **Disable ad blockers** — Some ad blockers or privacy extensions can interfere with Google's sign-in popup. Try temporarily disabling them.
4. **Allow popups** — If your browser blocks popups, the Google sign-in window may not appear. Allow popups for the PULSEIntel Pro website.
5. **Try a different browser** — If the button works in Chrome but not Safari (or vice versa), the issue may be browser-specific

## Google Sign-In Window Appears but Fails

**What's happening:** The Google sign-in window opens, but you get an error after selecting your account.

**Possible causes:**
- **Third-party cookies blocked** — Google Sign-In requires third-party cookies. Check your browser settings and make sure cookies are allowed for Google.
- **Browser is outdated** — Update your browser to the latest version
- **Incognito/Private mode** — Some privacy settings in incognito mode can block Google Sign-In. Try signing in from a regular browser window.

## Signed In with the Wrong Google Account

**What's happening:** You accidentally signed in with a personal Gmail instead of your work account (or vice versa).

**How to fix it:**
1. Sign out of PULSEIntel Pro (click your profile avatar > **Sign Out**)
2. Go to [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com) and make sure the correct Google account is active
3. Return to PULSEIntel Pro and click **Sign in with Google**
4. If multiple accounts appear, carefully select the correct one

<Tip>
Your PULSEIntel Pro account is tied to a specific Google email address. Always sign in with the same Google account you used when you first set up PULSEIntel Pro.
</Tip>

## "Account Not Found" or "Access Denied"

**What's happening:** You sign in with Google successfully, but PULSEIntel Pro says your account isn't found or you don't have access.

**Possible causes:**
- **New account** — If this is your first time, you'll need to create an account first. [Register at pulseintelpro.com](https://pulseintelpro.com) to get started.
- **Wrong email** — You may be signed in with a different Google account than the one linked to your PULSEIntel Pro account
- **Account suspended** — Your account may have been deactivated. Contact your administrator or [hello@pulseintelpro.com](mailto:hello@pulseintelpro.com)

## Session Expired / Signed Out Unexpectedly

**What's happening:** You were using PULSEIntel Pro and suddenly got sent back to the sign-in page.

**Why this happens:**
- Your sign-in session expired due to inactivity
- Your Google account session ended
- You signed out of Google in another tab or on another device

**How to fix it:**
Simply click **Sign in with Google** again. You'll be signed back in immediately if your Google session is still active.

## Can't Sign In on Mobile

**What's happening:** The Google Sign-In doesn't work on your phone or tablet.

**Try these steps:**
1. **Use your phone's default browser** — Google Sign-In works best in Chrome (Android) or Safari (iOS)
2. **Avoid in-app browsers** — If you're opening PULSEIntel Pro from a link in email or social media, the in-app browser may not support Google Sign-In. Copy the URL and paste it into your regular browser instead.
3. **Clear browser data** — Go to your browser settings and clear cookies and cache
4. **Update your browser** — Make sure you're running the latest version

## Two-Factor Authentication Issues

**What's happening:** Google is asking for a verification code and you can't complete it.

This is managed by your Google account, not PULSEIntel Pro:
- **Check your phone** — Google may be sending a verification prompt to your phone
- **Use backup codes** — If you set up backup codes for your Google account, you can use one
- **Recovery options** — Visit [accounts.google.com/signin/recovery](https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery) to recover access to your Google account

## Still Can't Sign In?

If none of the above solutions work:
1. Try signing in from a completely different device
2. Make sure you can sign into Google itself at [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)
3. Contact our support team at [hello@pulseintelpro.com](mailto:hello@pulseintelpro.com) with:
   - The Google email address you're trying to sign in with
   - What error message (if any) you're seeing
   - Which browser and device you're using
