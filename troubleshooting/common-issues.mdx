## Pages or Data Not Loading

**What's happening:** A page shows a loading spinner that never goes away, or data that should be there appears blank.

**Try these steps:**
1. **Refresh the page** — Press F5 or click the refresh button in your browser
2. **Pull to refresh on mobile** — Pull down from the top of the page
3. **Check your internet connection** — Make sure you're connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data (see [Connectivity Issues](/troubleshooting/connectivity-issues))
4. **Clear your browser cache** — Sometimes old cached data can cause issues
5. **Try a different browser** — If the issue persists, try Chrome, Safari, or Firefox

If the problem continues, contact [hello@pulseintelpro.com](mailto:hello@pulseintelpro.com).

## AI Agents Not Responding

**What's happening:** You send a message to NOVA, SIRIUS, or VEGA and don't get a response, or the response takes a very long time.

**Try these steps:**
1. **Wait a moment** — AI responses can occasionally take 10-15 seconds during peak usage
2. **Refresh the page** — This clears the current conversation session and lets you start fresh
3. **Check your credits** — If you've run out of credits, AI features may be limited. Check your balance in [Billing](/account/billing).
4. **Try again later** — If the AI service is experiencing high demand, responses may be temporarily delayed

## Content Not Generating

**What's happening:** You click Generate in the Content Studio or Marketing Hub but nothing happens or you get an error.

**Possible causes:**
- **Insufficient credits** — Check your credit balance at the top of the Content Studio. If it's zero, you'll need to wait for your monthly refill or purchase more in [Billing](/account/billing).
- **Network issue** — Make sure you have a stable internet connection
- **Try a different topic** — Occasionally certain topic combinations may cause issues. Try simplifying your request.

## Dashboard Tasks Not Appearing

**What's happening:** You open your Dashboard and the task list is empty.

**Possible causes:**
- **First-time setup** — Tasks are generated based on your goals and production plan. If you haven't completed the [setup wizard](/quickstart), tasks won't be generated yet.
- **All tasks completed** — If you've finished everything for today, the list may be empty. Check the "Completed" filter to see what you've done.
- **Data still loading** — Wait a few seconds for the page to fully load. On slower connections, this may take a moment.

## Goals Showing Wrong Numbers

**What's happening:** Your goal progress doesn't match what you expect.

**Try these steps:**
1. **Sync from CRM** — Click the **Sync from CRM** button on the Goals page to pull the latest data from your CRM
2. **Check your CRM data** — Make sure your contacts have the correct deal values, closing dates, and lead statuses in the CRM
3. **Update manually** — Click **Update Progress** on any goal to enter the correct numbers yourself

## RolePlay Call Not Connecting

**What's happening:** You start a RolePlay session but your phone never rings.

**Check these things:**
1. **Phone number** — Make sure your phone number is correct in your [Profile](/account/profile). Include the country code if needed.
2. **Phone ringer** — Check that your phone isn't on silent or Do Not Disturb mode
3. **Call blocking** — Some phones block unknown numbers by default. Check your phone's call blocking settings.
4. **Wait a moment** — The call may take 15-30 seconds to initiate after clicking Start

## CRM Import Failing

**What's happening:** You try to import contacts from a CSV file but get an error.

**Common fixes:**
- **Check your file format** — Make sure it's a .csv file (not .xlsx or .xls). If you have an Excel file, save it as CSV first.
- **Check for special characters** — Remove any special characters in the file that might cause parsing issues
- **Required fields** — Make sure your CSV includes at least a name column
- **File size** — Very large files may time out. Try splitting your list into smaller batches (500 contacts per file)

## Mobile Subscription or Payment Not Going Through

**What's happening:** You're trying to subscribe or upgrade on your phone but the checkout doesn't complete, or you get an error.

**Try these steps:**
1. **Refresh and retry** — Close the checkout screen, return to Billing, and try again
2. **Check your payment details** — Make sure the card number, expiration date, and CVV are entered correctly
3. **Try a different card** — If one card is declined, try another
4. **Contact your bank** — Some banks flag mobile purchases from new merchants. Call to authorize the charge.
5. **Switch to desktop** — If mobile checkout continues to fail, open PULSEIntel Pro in a desktop browser and complete the subscription there
6. **Contact support** — If none of the above works, reach out to [hello@pulseintelpro.com](mailto:hello@pulseintelpro.com) and we'll help you get set up manually

## Getting Signed Out Unexpectedly

**What's happening:** You're being signed out of PULSEIntel Pro without logging out yourself.

**Why this happens:**
- PULSEIntel Pro automatically signs you out after **30 minutes of inactivity** for security reasons
- Your session may also expire if you have connectivity issues that interrupt your connection

**What to do:**
1. Sign back in with your Google account — this takes just a moment
2. Your data and unsaved work will be waiting for you
3. If you're frequently signed out while actively using the app, check your internet connection

To avoid unexpected sign-outs, keep the app active while you're working. If you step away, expect to need to sign back in after 30 minutes.

## Can't Find a Feature

**What's happening:** A feature described in this help center doesn't appear in your app.

**Possible reasons:**
- **Subscription tier** — Some features are only available on Subscriber or Subscriber Plus plans. Check [what's included in your plan](/quickstart#whats-included-in-your-plan).
- **Setup not complete** — Certain features require completing the onboarding wizard first
- **Mobile vs. desktop** — Some features have a simplified view on mobile. Try accessing the feature on a desktop browser for the full experience.
