## Pages or Data Not Loading

**What's happening:** A page shows a loading spinner that never goes away, or data that should be there appears blank.

**Try these steps:**
1. **Refresh the page** — Press F5 or click the refresh button in your browser
2. **Pull to refresh on mobile** — Pull down from the top of the page
3. **Check your internet connection** — Make sure you're connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data (see [Connectivity Issues](/troubleshooting/connectivity-issues))
4. **Clear your browser cache** — Sometimes old cached data can cause issues
5. **Try a different browser** — If the issue persists, try Chrome, Safari, or Firefox

If the problem continues, contact [support@pwru.com](mailto:support@pwru.com).

## AI Agents Not Responding

**What's happening:** You send a message to NOVA, SIRIUS, or VEGA and don't get a response, or the response takes a very long time.

**Try these steps:**
1. **Wait a moment** — AI responses can occasionally take 10-15 seconds during peak usage
2. **Refresh the page** — This clears the current conversation session and lets you start fresh
3. **Check your credits** — If you've run out of credits, AI features may be limited. Check your balance in [Billing](/account/billing).
4. **Try again later** — If the AI service is experiencing high demand, responses may be temporarily delayed

## Content Not Generating

**What's happening:** You click Generate in the Content Studio or Marketing Hub but nothing happens or you get an error.

**Possible causes:**
- **Insufficient credits** — Check your credit balance at the top of the Content Studio. If it's zero, you'll need to wait for your monthly refill or purchase more in [Billing](/account/billing).
- **Network issue** — Make sure you have a stable internet connection
- **Try a different topic** — Occasionally certain topic combinations may cause issues. Try simplifying your request.

## Dashboard Tasks Not Appearing

**What's happening:** You open your Dashboard and the task list is empty.

**Possible causes:**
- **First-time setup** — Tasks are generated based on your goals and production plan. If you haven't completed the [setup wizard](/quickstart), tasks won't be generated yet.
- **All tasks completed** — If you've finished everything for today, the list may be empty. Check the "Completed" filter to see what you've done.
- **Data still loading** — Wait a few seconds for the page to fully load. On slower connections, this may take a moment.

## Goals Showing Wrong Numbers

**What's happening:** Your goal progress doesn't match what you expect.

**Try these steps:**
1. **Sync from CRM** — Click the **Sync from CRM** button on the Goals page to pull the latest data from your CRM
2. **Check your CRM data** — Make sure your contacts have the correct deal values, closing dates, and lead statuses in the CRM
3. **Update manually** — Click **Update Progress** on any goal to enter the correct numbers yourself

## RolePlay Call Not Connecting

**What's happening:** You start a RolePlay session but your phone never rings.

**Check these things:**
1. **Phone number** — Make sure your phone number is correct in your [Profile](/account/profile). Include the country code if needed.
2. **Phone ringer** — Check that your phone isn't on silent or Do Not Disturb mode
3. **Call blocking** — Some phones block unknown numbers by default. Check your phone's call blocking settings.
4. **Wait a moment** — The call may take 15-30 seconds to initiate after clicking Start

## CRM Import Failing

**What's happening:** You try to import contacts from a CSV file but get an error.

**Common fixes:**
- **Check your file format** — Make sure it's a .csv file (not .xlsx or .xls). If you have an Excel file, save it as CSV first.
- **Check for special characters** — Remove any special characters in the file that might cause parsing issues
- **Required fields** — Make sure your CSV includes at least a name column
- **File size** — Very large files may time out. Try splitting your list into smaller batches (500 contacts per file)

## Can't Find a Feature

**What's happening:** A feature described in this help center doesn't appear in your app.

**Possible reasons:**
- **Subscription tier** — Some features are only available on Subscriber or Subscriber Plus plans. Check [what's included in your plan](/quickstart#whats-included-in-your-plan).
- **Setup not complete** — Certain features require completing the onboarding wizard first
- **Mobile vs. desktop** — Some features have a simplified view on mobile. Try accessing the feature on a desktop browser for the full experience.
