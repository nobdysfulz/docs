PULSEIntel Pro takes the security of your account and data seriously. Here's what you need to know about keeping your account safe.

## How Sign-In Works

PULSEIntel Pro uses **Google OAuth** for authentication. This means:
- You sign in with your existing Google account
- PULSEIntel Pro never stores your Google password
- Your sign-in security is managed by Google, including any two-factor authentication you've set up on your Google account
- Sessions stay active until you sign out or your session expires

<Tip>
Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** on your Google account for the strongest protection. This secures both your Google account and your PULSEIntel Pro access. You can set this up at [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
</Tip>

## Session Timeout

For your security, PULSEIntel Pro automatically signs you out after **30 minutes of inactivity**. This protects your account if you step away from your computer or leave a browser tab open.

- You'll see a warning before the session expires so you have a chance to stay signed in
- Any unsaved work will be preserved — you'll pick up where you left off after signing back in
- On mobile, the app keeps your session active as long as the app is in the foreground

If you're being signed out more frequently than expected, check that you're not leaving the app idle for extended periods on shared devices.

## Security Settings

To access security settings:
1. Go to **Settings > Security**
2. Review and manage your security preferences

### What You Can Do
- **Review active sessions** — See where your account is currently signed in
- **Sign out of all sessions** — Force sign-out from all devices if you suspect unauthorized access
- **Review connected services** — See which integrations have access to your account data

## Protecting Your Account

### Use a Strong Google Account
Since PULSEIntel Pro relies on Google Sign-In, your Google account security is your first line of defense:
- Use a strong, unique password for your Google account
- Enable 2-step verification on your Google account
- Regularly review your Google account's security checkup at [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com)

### Be Careful on Shared Devices
- Always sign out of PULSEIntel Pro when using a shared or public computer
- Don't check "Remember me" or stay signed into Google on shared devices
- Use your browser's private/incognito mode on shared computers

### Watch for Suspicious Activity
If you notice anything unusual in your account:
- Contacts you didn't add
- Tasks you didn't create
- Settings that have changed
- Sign-in notifications you don't recognize

Take these steps immediately:
1. Change your Google account password
2. Go to **Settings > Security** and sign out of all sessions
3. Review your connected integrations and remove any you don't recognize
4. Contact [support@pwru.com](mailto:support@pwru.com) to report the issue
