PULSEIntel Pro takes the security of your account and data seriously. Here's what you need to know about keeping your account safe.

## How Sign-In Works

PULSEIntel Pro uses **Google OAuth** for authentication. This means:
- You sign in with your existing Google account
- PULSEIntel Pro never stores your Google password
- Your sign-in security is managed by Google, including any two-factor authentication you've set up on your Google account
- Sessions stay active until you sign out or your session expires

<Tip>
Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** on your Google account for the strongest protection. This secures both your Google account and your PULSEIntel Pro access. You can set this up at [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
</Tip>

## Security Settings

To access security settings:
1. Go to **Settings > Security**
2. Review and manage your security preferences

### What You Can Do
- **Review active sessions** — See where your account is currently signed in
- **Sign out of all sessions** — Force sign-out from all devices if you suspect unauthorized access
- **Review connected services** — See which integrations have access to your account data

## Protecting Your Account

### Use a Strong Google Account
Since PULSEIntel Pro relies on Google Sign-In, your Google account security is your first line of defense:
- Use a strong, unique password for your Google account
- Enable 2-step verification on your Google account
- Regularly review your Google account's security checkup at [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com)

### Be Careful on Shared Devices
- Always sign out of PULSEIntel Pro when using a shared or public computer
- Don't check "Remember me" or stay signed into Google on shared devices
- Use your browser's private/incognito mode on shared computers

### Watch for Suspicious Activity
If you notice anything unusual in your account:
- Contacts you didn't add
- Tasks you didn't create
- Settings that have changed
- Sign-in notifications you don't recognize

Take these steps immediately:
1. Change your Google account password
2. Go to **Settings > Security** and sign out of all sessions
3. Review your connected integrations and remove any you don't recognize
4. Contact [support@pwru.com](mailto:support@pwru.com) to report the issue
