The Settings page is your central hub for configuring how PULSEIntel Pro works for you. Access it by clicking your profile avatar in the top-right corner and selecting **Settings**, or by clicking **Settings** in the left sidebar.

## Preferences

Customize how the platform works for you:

1. Go to **Settings > Preferences**
2. Adjust your settings:
   - **Working hours** — Set the days and times you're available. This affects when daily tasks are scheduled.
   - **Communication style** — Choose your preferred communication tone (formal, conversational, direct)
   - **Default views** — Set which views load by default in different sections

## Notification Settings

Control what notifications you receive and how:

1. Go to **Settings > Notifications**
2. Toggle notifications on or off for:
   - **Email notifications** — Receive updates and reminders via email
   - **Push notifications** — Get alerts on your device
   - **Alert frequency** — Choose how often you'd like to be notified (immediately, daily digest, weekly summary)

## Integrations

Connect PULSEIntel Pro to the other tools you use:

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations**
2. Browse available integrations
3. Click **Connect** next to the service you want to link

### Available Integrations

| Integration | What It Does |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Lofty CRM** | Sync your contacts and activities from Lofty into PULSEIntel Pro |
| **Follow Up Boss** | Sync your contacts and activities from Follow Up Boss |
| **Social Media Accounts** | Connect your social accounts for content publishing |
| **Calendar** | Sync your calendar for scheduling awareness |

### CRM Sync

If you connect Lofty or Follow Up Boss:

1. Go to **Settings > CRM**
2. Choose your connected CRM
3. Enable **Sync Goals** to automatically update your goal progress based on CRM data
4. Configure sync preferences

<Tip>
If you're already using an external CRM, connecting it is the fastest way to populate your PULSEIntel Pro CRM with contacts and keep your goal progress up to date.
