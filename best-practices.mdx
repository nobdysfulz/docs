Getting the most out of PULSEIntel Pro means building daily habits around the platform. Here are proven strategies from top-performing agents.

## Build a Daily Routine

The most successful PULSEIntel Pro users follow a consistent daily rhythm:

**Morning (15 minutes)**
1. Open your **Dashboard** and review today's AI-generated action plan
2. Check the **Daily Brief** card for your current scores and streak
3. Start with the high-priority tasks — these have the biggest impact on your goals

**Throughout the Day**
4. Complete tasks as you go and **log outcomes** (leads generated, appointments set, notes)
5. Use the **Content Studio** to create and schedule your daily social media post
6. Check the **CRM** after meetings to update contact statuses and add notes

**End of Day (5 minutes)**
7. Review any remaining tasks — snooze what you'll do tomorrow, skip what's no longer relevant
8. Check your **Goals** progress to see how today moved the needle

## Get More from Your AI Agents

### Talk to NOVA Like a Business Partner
NOVA is your AI executive assistant. The more context you give her, the better her advice. Instead of asking "What should I do?", try:
- "I have 3 listing presentations this week. Help me prioritize my prep."
- "My pipeline has stalled this month. What activities should I focus on?"
- "Draft a follow-up strategy for the leads I met at last weekend's open house."

### Keep Your Agent Guidelines Updated
Each AI agent has customizable guidelines that shape how they respond to you. Visit the **Guidelines** panel on the AI Agents page to:
- Set your preferred communication tone (professional, conversational, direct)
- Add context about your brand voice and target market
- Specify any topics or approaches you want the agents to emphasize or avoid

### Upload to Your Knowledge Base
Give your agents better context by uploading documents to the **Knowledge Base** panel:
- Your brokerage's marketing materials
- Market reports for your area
- Past listing presentations that performed well
- Scripts and talking points you already use

## Keep Your CRM Current

Your CRM data powers many features across the platform — goal tracking, task generation, and intelligence scoring all rely on up-to-date contacts.

**Do this weekly:**
- Add new contacts from open houses, referrals, and networking events
- Update pipeline stages when deals move forward
- Log activities (calls, meetings, emails) to keep your activity scores accurate
- Tag contacts for easy segmentation when creating marketing campaigns

**Pro tip:** If you use Lofty or Follow Up Boss, connect your CRM in [Settings](/account/settings) to sync contacts and activities automatically.

## Make the Most of Content Studio

- **Set your preferences first** — Go to the Preferences tab and configure your default tone, content length, and market focus. This saves you time on every generation.
- **Use weekly content packs** — The calendar view shows pre-planned content topics for each day. Generate all your weekly content on Monday morning and you're set.
- **Personalize before posting** — AI-generated content is a great starting point. Add a personal anecdote, local detail, or your own voice before publishing.
- **Build your template library** — Save content that performs well and use it as inspiration for future generations.

## Track Goals Consistently

- **Review weekly** — Check your Goals page at least once a week to stay aware of your progress
- **Sync from CRM** — If you're logging activities in the CRM, use the "Sync from CRM" button to automatically update your goal progress
- **Read the AI insights** — The Insights tab on the Goals page provides actionable recommendations based on your current trajectory
- **Adjust when needed** — If a goal is consistently showing "At Risk," consider adjusting your daily activities or the goal target itself. It's better to have realistic targets you can push toward.

## Use Intelligence Scores to Improve

Your **PGIC Intelligence Score** is made up of three components:

- **PULSE** — Measures how consistently you execute daily tasks. Keep this high by completing your dashboard tasks every day.
- **GANE** — Tracks how effectively you use the platform's tools. Explore features like automations, templates, and the Marketing Hub to boost this score.
- **MORO** — Analyzes your market opportunity. This improves as you define your market territory and the system gathers local data.

Check the Intelligence page weekly to spot trends and act on the recommendations.

## Practice with RolePlay

- **Start with beginner scenarios** — Build confidence before moving to advanced objection handling
- **Review your analysis** — After each session, read the performance breakdown carefully. Focus on one area to improve at a time.
- **Save useful scripts** — Browse the Scripts tab for pre-built objection handling guides. Export them as PDFs to review before client meetings.
- **Practice regularly** — Even 10 minutes a week of role-play practice measurably improves your real-world conversations.

## Stay Organized

- **Use one platform** — PULSEIntel Pro works best when you centralize your workflow here rather than splitting across multiple tools
- **Check notifications** — The notification bell in the top bar keeps you informed about important updates
- **Keep your profile current** — An up-to-date profile helps AI agents give you personalized advice. Update it in [Profile](/account/profile) whenever your business changes.
