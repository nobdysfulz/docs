## Signing In

PULSEIntel Pro uses **Google Sign-In** to keep things simple and secure. You don't need to create a separate password.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open PULSEIntel Pro">
    Navigate to the PULSEIntel Pro app in your web browser. You'll see the sign-in page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in with Google">
    Click the **Sign in with Google** button. You'll be redirected to Google's sign-in page where you can select your Google account. If you're already signed into Google, you may be signed in automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Access">
    The first time you sign in, Google will ask you to authorize PULSEIntel Pro to access your basic profile information (name and email). Click **Allow** to continue.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use the same Google account every time you sign in. Your PULSEIntel Pro account is linked to your Google email address.
</Tip>

## Setting Up Your Account

After your first sign-in, you'll be guided through a setup wizard. This only takes a few minutes, and it helps PULSEIntel Pro personalize everything for you.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tell Us About Yourself">
    Enter your name, phone number, and upload a profile photo. This information appears across the platform and in your AI agent interactions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Business">
    Share your brokerage name, role, years of experience, and specializations. This helps our AI agents understand your business context and give you better recommendations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Your Market">
    Tell us where you work — your city, state, and target zip codes. This powers localized content generation and market intelligence features.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Your Income Goals">
    Enter your annual income target. The **Production Planner** automatically breaks this down into the number of deals, appointments, and contacts you'll need each month and week to hit your goals.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Preferences">
    Set your working hours, preferred communication style, content tone, and notification preferences. You can always change these later in [Settings](/account/settings).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Meet Your AI Agents">
    Get introduced to your AI team — NOVA, SIRIUS, and VEGA. Each agent is customizable, and you can adjust their guidelines at any time. Learn more in [AI Agents](/features/ai-agents).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
You'll need to complete the setup wizard before you can access the rest of the platform. If you need to step away, your progress is saved and you can pick up where you left off next time you sign in.
</Warning>

## Finding Your Way Around

### On Desktop

Your screen is organized into a few key areas:

- **Left sidebar** — Your main menu. Click any item to navigate to that section (Dashboard, AI Agents, Goals, CRM, Content Studio, etc.)
- **Top bar** — Search for anything, check your notifications, and access your profile
- **Page tabs** — When you're inside a section like CRM or AI Agents, you'll see tabs across the top to switch between views (e.g., Contacts, Pipeline, Conversations)
- **Right panel** — A detail panel that shows additional information based on what you're viewing (contact details, AI insights, content previews, etc.)

### On Mobile

PULSEIntel Pro is fully optimized for your phone:

- **Bottom navigation bar** — Tap to switch between the main sections
- **Pull down to refresh** — Pull down on most pages to load the latest data
- **Slide-in panels** — Tap items to see details in a panel that slides in from the right

## Your First Day

Here's what we recommend doing after you complete setup:

1. **Check your Dashboard** — Your AI-generated daily action plan is waiting. Start with the high-priority tasks at the top.
2. **Import your contacts** — Head to the [CRM](/features/crm) and import your existing contact list so you can start managing relationships right away.
3. **Generate some content** — Try the [Content Studio](/features/content-studio) to create a social media post or email script about your market.
4. **Set a goal** — Go to [Goals](/features/goals) to review the targets from your Production Planner and make sure they feel right.
5. **Chat with NOVA** — Open [AI Agents](/features/ai-agents) and ask NOVA anything about your business strategy. She's your AI executive assistant.
