## Overview

PWRU is accessed as a web application. After signing up, you complete an onboarding wizard that configures your business plan, goals, and AI agent preferences.

## First Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up & Authenticate">
    Create your account or sign in with your existing credentials. Authentication is handled via the Base44 auth system. After signing in, you are redirected to the main application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Onboarding">
    New users are guided through a multi-step onboarding wizard that collects:
    - Personal and business information
    - Market territory and specialization
    - Income goals and production targets
    - Preferred working schedule and communication style

    See the [Onboarding Guide](/onboarding) for details on each step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Production Plan">
    The Production Planner helps you reverse-engineer your income goals into daily and weekly activity targets. It calculates required GCI, deals, listings, appointments, and lead contacts based on your conversion rates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore Core Features">
    After onboarding, your home page is the **Dashboard (ToDo)** with AI-generated daily tasks. From there, explore:
    - [AI Agents](/features/ai-agents) for executive assistance and content creation
    - [Goals](/features/goals) to track your production targets
    - [CRM](/features/crm) to manage your contacts and pipeline
